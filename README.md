- 👋 Hi, I’m @XiaoJin0501
- 👀 I’m interested in radar signal processing, AI (e.g. machine learning, deep learning, multimodal), and wireless communication techniques and their applications, such as vital sign detection (based on RF sensors), hand gesture recognition (HGR), human activities recognition (HAR), and other applications that are related to human-computer interaction (HCI) or Internet of things (IoT). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning digital signal processing techniques and algorithms and basic knowledge of deep learning skills to enhance the accuracy rate performance of pattern recognition.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any promising teams or companies, and work on the next generation of AI applications.

Hope to know people from all over the world!
